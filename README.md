# Chug
Chug is a small tabletop companion bot, capable of moving, expressing emotions via its eyes, and producing sound effects.
I would be using a Seeed Studio Xioa ESP32S3 Sense as the brain of the bot. The bot would use 2 N20 motors with Encoders for its movement.
A 128×96 SSD1327 1.32-inch OLED display would show the animated eyes of the bot, allowing it to express emotions like happiness, anger, etc.
An 8-ohm speaker, along with an Adafruit MAX98357A I2S 3W Class D Amplifier, is used to give the bot a mouth.
An MPU6050 is also included to allow the bot to detect when it is pushed around or picked from the ground, allowing for more emotive responses.
